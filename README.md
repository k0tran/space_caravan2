## Motivation
This game took inspiration from `Space Caravan` - a student project where I was teamlead. \
It came out really scuffed in my opinion, but I liked it nonetheless. \
So years after I decided to make the second part as gamedev practice and asked my friend for assistance.

## How to build

To build simply write `zig build` and `zig build run` to run

Dependencies:
- zig 0.11.0
- curl
- git
- libgamemode (for me)
